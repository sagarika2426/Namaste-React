Monolith:
A monolithic architecture is a singular, large computing network with one code base that couples all of the business concerns together. To make a change to this sort of application requires updating the entire stack by accessing the code base and building and deploying an updated version of the service-side interface.

Microservices:
separtions of concerns
It follows single responsible principle
Microservices architecture is a collection of smaller, independently deployable services.
