Good coding practices: 

Make a component folder and put components in diiff file and store there
You can use .js or .jsx. it hardly matters
dont keep hard coded data in your components
create a utility/config folder and put all the unitility in that folder
create a constant.js file and keep all the hard coded data here

There are two types of export and import
1. Default export
2. Named export - in single file when you have to export more than one file
You can do the names export by just adding export keyword infront of const 

can i use default and named export together?
